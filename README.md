# Volume Control using Gestures

The code is used to change the volume with help of hand gestures. By adjusting the distance between the index and thumb, we can change the volume accordingly.

The required libraries are:
  opencv, numpy, comtypes and pycaw.
  
The installation command is [windows]:

  pip install opencv-python
  
  pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
  
  pip install comtypes
  
  pip install pycaw



**NOTE**:
The given program assumes that u have a pre-existing model for detecting hand that is named as "handdetector".
If u aldready don't have a detector model, built or download it first and then run the volume control program.

The model can be dowloaded at https://github.com/DarkFalcon12/hand-detection
